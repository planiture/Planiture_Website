                                The Solar System[b] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it,
                                either directly or indirectly.[c] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the
                                eight planets,[d] with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
                                Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[e]
                                <br />
                                The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
                                molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass
                                contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets,
                                being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more
                                massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly
                                of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of
                                substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water,
                                ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
